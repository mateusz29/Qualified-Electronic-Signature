# Tool for Emulating the Qualified Electronic Signature
The project was developed as part of the Security of Computer Systems course. 

The goal of the project is to make a software tool for emulating the qualified electronic signature, e.g. signing documents, and moreover basic ciphering operations.

Before using the application, the RSA keys must be generated for the user A and the private one must be encrypted by the AES algorithm and user A PIN number. A secondary application has this functionality, it will emulate the trusted third party (TTP).
